## About Me
After graduating from college, I got a job as an installer of electronic equipment and devices 
of the 5th grade, then increased the grade to 6th and rested on the "ceiling". 
Then he entered the university with a degree in infocommunication technologies and communication systems, 
where he studied the hardware of devices that are used in various types of communications. 
Since last year, I was interested in the software component and my attention was attracted 
not by the development of programs for communication equipment, but by web development, 
in particular, the frontend. I take many courses and intensives that allow me to learn 
new things in front-end development.

## Code Example
**Bit Counting KATA from CODEWARS:**
>Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
 

**Solution**
```
let countBits = function(n) {
  let count = 0;
  while (n > 0.5) {
    n = n / 2;
    if (n !== Math.ceil(n)) {
      count += 1;
      n = Math.floor(n);
    }
  }
  return count
};
```
